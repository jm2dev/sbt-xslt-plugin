* SBT XSLT Plugin

[[https://github.com/harrah/xsbt][Simple Build Tool]] for trasnforming XML files using Saxon HE XSL Transformer.

** Usage

Insert the following lines in your *project/plugins.sbt* file

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
resolvers += Resolver.url("scalasbt", new URL("http://scalasbt.artifactoryonline.com/scalasbt/sbt-plugin-releases"))(Resolver.ivyStylePatterns)

addSbtPlugin("com.jm2dev" %% "sbt-xslt-plugin" % "0.1.6")
#+END_SRC

Place the files you want to transform under *src/main/xml* while the
transformation file is expected to be *src/main/xslt/main.xsl*

Successful output is found in *target/xslt-plugin/* directory.

** Misc

The *samples* directory includes a very simple and working sbt project
for experimentation.

*** Notes

[fn:1] Yes, I like naming my XSLT files with the xsl suffix. I
    recommend you to do the same to avoid errors.

[fn:2] Please, check the version number, currently latest version is 0.1.6
